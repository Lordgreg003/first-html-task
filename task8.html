      although we jut go to know each other,well i would appreciate us been good
      friends in sincerity,honesty and trust.to share ideas and discuss more
      isues as we talk more about our selves,and i believe as time goes on there
      might be something great for us in future.....what do think
    </p>
    <p>
      in my entire life i have always belived and lived with three great
      qualitis-trust,honesty ,and loyality which is the sucess namtra of a great
      friendship or relationshi.passive

    <p>
      true love is based on trust,and if the trust isn't there,loves dies
      quickly.i want to tell you how much i love you and how much i trust
      you,and of course i want you to know that my love for you is deep and
      intense that i would never betray your trust in me,not for anythingh
    </p>

      although in sone situation you may be decieved if you trust too much,you
      would live in torment if you dont trust enough because life never seems to
      be the way we always want it,but we must learn to live it to the fullest
      and the best way can.there is no perfect life,but we can fil it with
      perfect moments & with wonderful people around who we can trust to call
      our friend in any situation

      people are very diffrent as to how easily they trust people-some have bben
      seriously hurt in thye past and hesitate to trust again.others are very
      "trusting",even of those who dont deserve their trust.i believe one of the
      most valuable things you can to create higher levels of trust is to trust
      others more dont wait for them them prove them selves to you trust them!!
    </p>

      you can easily earn a persons trust by consistently proving yourself to
      them.you show them that you will not use them or take advantage of
      them.you would not abuse their love or generosity.you would think of them
      first before acting no matter the sitaution
    </p>
    <p>
      trust is both an emotional and logical act.Emotionally,it is where you
      expose your vulnerabities to people but believing they would not rake
      advantage of your openness .Logically,its where you have assessed the
      probabilities of gain or loss calculating expected utility based on hard
      performance data ,and concluded that the person in question will behave in
      predictable manner.in practice,trust is a bit both
